    description: "The baseline scenario (with BL suffix) represents 'business as usual'. This
    scenario reflects: forecast changes to the amount of water available, through planned
    changes to abstraction licences and through reductions to supply from climate change;
    continuation of current policies in demand management (including the committed leakage
    levels, metering policies and implementation of companiesâ€™ water efficiency plans); and
    forecast changes to properties and population."

    description: "The final planning scenario (with FP suffix) represents the company's
    forecast supply and demand as a result of the implementation of the additional supply
    and/or reduced demand options incorporated into its forecasts. This is the scenario that
    represents what a water company intends to do over the planning period to maintain the
    balance of supply and demand."
