# Specify the mapping of model timesteps to durations within a year
# assume modelling 365 days (no extra day in leap years, no leap seconds)

# Each time interval must have
# - start (period since beginning of year)
# - end (period since beginning of year)
# - id (label to use when passing between integration layer and sector model)

# use ISO 8601 duration format to specify periods = P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S
# - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations

# Here we specify monthly values, assuming the model has a four outputs, each
# corresponding to a typical month in the given season, we map the model outputs
# to the whole year's duration.

# If the model were to output an hourly value instead, we would map that to 8760
# intervals, each one hour long, again covering the whole year.
