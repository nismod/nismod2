  description: >
    NISMOD v2 Transport Model is a national-scale (Great Britain) transport model
    developed to support policy making regarding the future infrastructure. It
    forecasts the impact of various endogenous and exogenous factors on transport
    demand and capacity utilisation, following an elasticity-based simulation
    methodology. The model consists of three submodels covering the following modes
    of transport: road (passenger and freight vehicle flows), rail (total station
    usage), and air (domestic and international passenger movements).
