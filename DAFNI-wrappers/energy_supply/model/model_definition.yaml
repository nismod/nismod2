  name: nismod-energy-supply
  summary: National Infrastructure Systems Model
  type: systems of systems
  description: >
    The NISMOD Energy Supply model provides the capability to perform integrated
    analyses of the whole energy system in Great Britain from supply sources,
    generation, transmission, distribution and end-use. The model is built on an
    optimisation framework. It performs integrated optimal operation of the
    energy system across electricity, gas, heat, and hydrogen networks. The
    model can deliver insights and evaluation of national energy infrastructure
    and its interconnectedness with global energy systems and through an energy
    hub concept that models interactions with local energy systems.
