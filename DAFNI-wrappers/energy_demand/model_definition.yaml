  name: nismod-energy-demand
  summary: National Infrastructure Systems Model (preliminary upload No.9)
  type: systems of systems
  description: >
    HIRE (HIgh-Resolution Energy demand model) simulates energy demand for the
    United Kingdom at an hourly / Local Authority District scale. Future energy
    demand is simulated based on different scenario data and socio-technical
    drivers such as technological efficiencies, changes in the technological mix
    of an end use, consumption and behavioural change. Scenario data includes
    population, regional Gross Value Added, residential and commercial
    floorspace, and temperature.
